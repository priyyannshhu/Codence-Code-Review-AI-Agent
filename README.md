> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This is a local machine-based AI Code Reviewer.
> 
> While it's deployed on Vercel for preview, **the live link is for UI demonstration only**. The application won't work as expected in the browser alone since it requires local setup and API credentials.
> 
> **To use this tool properly:**
> 1. Clone the repository
> 2. Set up your local environment (Node.js, Convex, `.env` with your `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
> 3. Run it locally using `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
> 
> The Gemini API runs server-side and relies on your local credentials. **This is not a SaaS application.**
